# Console-Finances

This is my submission for Assignment 5. In this assignmentm, we were tasked with using our newly learned JavaScirpt SKills to analyze a set of financial records for a company. In addition to the skills we learned in class, we had to do some independent research to complete certain portions of the assignment.
